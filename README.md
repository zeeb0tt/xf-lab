# XenForo Docker Test Lab

Disposable Docker/ngrok test environments for XenForo add-on developers.

Spin up a specific XenForo version on a specific PHP version, mount an add-on, optionally expose it through a public HTTPS ngrok tunnel, test what you need, then destroy the whole thing.

This project is intended for development and compatibility testing only.

---

## What this does

`xf-lab` lets you run commands like:

```bash
./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.3
```

or:

```bash
PUBLIC=ngrok ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn ./scripts/xf-up 2.1.15 7.2
```

The script will:

1. find the matching XenForo ZIP in `archives/`;
2. extract the XenForo `upload/` files into a disposable instance folder;
3. create `src/config.php`;
4. build/start a PHP/Apache container for the selected PHP version;
5. start a MariaDB database;
6. optionally start an ngrok public HTTPS tunnel;
7. run the XenForo CLI installer;
8. optionally mount and install/rebuild your add-on;
9. print the forum/admin URL and login details.

Generated installs live under `instances/` and can be deleted at any time.

---

## Important licensing notes

This repository does **not** contain XenForo code.

You must have a valid XenForo licence and supply your own XenForo ZIP downloads. Do not commit XenForo ZIPs, extracted XenForo files, generated instances, or commercial add-on files to a public repository.

Public tunnel mode is useful for testing external callbacks/webhooks, but do not leave public test installs running longer than necessary. Treat every instance created by this tool as disposable.

---

## Requirements

You need:

- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2
- `unzip`
- `python3`
- Bash-compatible shell
- optional: `ngrok` for public tunnel mode

On macOS, the usual setup is:

```bash
brew install ngrok
```

Then add your ngrok authtoken once when you first run public mode, or pass it as `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN`.

## Directory layout

```text
xf-lab/
  archives/              # put licensed XenForo ZIP files here
  addons/                # optional local add-on source mounts
  docker/php/            # PHP/Apache Dockerfile and PHP ini
  scripts/               # helper commands
  tools/                 # XenForo CLI installer wrapper
  instances/             # generated disposable installs, ignored by git
```

---

## Add your XenForo ZIP files

Put your licensed XenForo downloads in:

```text
archives/
```

Name each file exactly like:

```text
xenforo-2.1.15.zip
xenforo-2.2.19.zip
xenforo-2.3.10.zip
```

The version in the filename is what you pass to `xf-up`.

For example:

```bash
./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.3
```

expects:

```text
archives/xenforo-2.3.10.zip
```

The ZIP can contain the usual XenForo `upload/` directory. The script will locate and copy that into the generated instance.

---

## First run

Make scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/* tools/*
```

Start a local-only XenForo instance:

```bash
./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.3
```

You should get output similar to:

```text
Instance ready.

  Forum:  http://localhost:8233/
  Admin:  http://localhost:8233/admin.php
  User:   admin
  Pass:   Admin123Pass
```

The port is calculated from the XenForo/PHP versions so multiple instances can run side by side.

---

## Start with a custom port

```bash
PORT=9090 ./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.3
```

---

## Mount and test an add-on

For an add-on with ID:

```text
Vendor/AddOn
```

place it here:

```text
addons/Vendor/AddOn/addon.json
```

Then run:

```bash
ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn ./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.3
```

The add-on is mounted into:

```text
src/addons/Vendor/AddOn
```

inside the generated XenForo install.

### Use an external add-on path

You can keep your add-on in another repo:

```bash
ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn \
ADDON_SOURCE=/Users/you/code/my-addon/src/addons/Vendor/AddOn \
./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.3
```

You can also point `ADDON_SOURCE` at a project root that contains:

```text
src/addons/Vendor/AddOn/addon.json
```

or:

```text
addons/Vendor/AddOn/addon.json
```

---

## Public HTTPS tunnel with ngrok

Some add-ons need the XenForo install to be reachable from an external backend, webhook, or API service.

Use public mode:

```bash
PUBLIC=ngrok \
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN='YOUR_NGROK_TOKEN' \
ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn \
./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.3
```

The script will:

1. start Docker;
2. start ngrok;
3. read the public HTTPS URL from the local ngrok agent API;
4. install XenForo using that public URL as the board URL.

Example output:

```text
ngrok public URL: https://example.ngrok-free.app

Instance ready.

  Forum:  https://example.ngrok-free.app/
  Admin:  https://example.ngrok-free.app/admin.php
  Basic auth: zee / generated-password
  User:   admin
  Pass:   Admin123Pass
```

### ngrok authtoken storage

On first public run, pass:

```bash
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN='YOUR_NGROK_TOKEN'
```

The script stores it under the generated instance folder so you do not need to pass it every time for that same instance.

Generated instance folders are ignored by git.

---

## Basic Auth for public tunnels

Public ngrok mode enables HTTP Basic Auth by default.

That is intentional because public XenForo test installs should not be left openly accessible.

Default credentials are:

```text
username: zee
password: generated per instance
```

You can set your own:

```bash
PUBLIC=ngrok \
NGROK_AUTH_USER=dev \
NGROK_AUTH_PASS='SomeLongPassword123' \
ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn \
./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.3
```

### Disable Basic Auth

If your external backend must call XenForo and cannot send Basic Auth credentials, disable it:

```bash
PUBLIC=ngrok \
NGROK_AUTH=0 \
ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn \
./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.3
```

Only do this while actively testing. Stop or destroy the instance afterwards.

---

## Use a reserved/static ngrok URL

If your ngrok account has a reserved/static domain, pass it with `NGROK_URL`:

```bash
PUBLIC=ngrok \
NGROK_URL=https://your-static-domain.ngrok-free.app \
ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn \
./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.3
```

This is useful when your backend stores or validates the board URL.

---

## Suggested compatibility matrix

Use the combinations that make sense for your add-on and the XenForo versions you support.

Common examples:

```bash
./scripts/xf-up 2.1.15 7.2
./scripts/xf-up 2.1.15 7.4

./scripts/xf-up 2.2.19 7.4
./scripts/xf-up 2.2.19 8.0
./scripts/xf-up 2.2.19 8.1
./scripts/xf-up 2.2.19 8.2

./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.1
./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.2
./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.3
./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.4
```

Older PHP images may require archived Debian package repositories. The included Dockerfile handles the common PHP 7.2 / Debian Buster case.

---

## Helper commands

### List generated instances

```bash
./scripts/xf-list
```

### Open a shell inside the PHP container

```bash
./scripts/xf-shell 2.3.10 8.3
```

### Run a command inside the PHP container

```bash
./scripts/xf-run 2.3.10 8.3 -- php -v
```

```bash
./scripts/xf-run 2.3.10 8.3 -- php cmd.php list
```

### Run add-on commands

```bash
ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn ./scripts/xf-addon 2.3.10 8.3 install
ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn ./scripts/xf-addon 2.3.10 8.3 upgrade
ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn ./scripts/xf-addon 2.3.10 8.3 rebuild
ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn ./scripts/xf-addon 2.3.10 8.3 uninstall
ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn ./scripts/xf-addon 2.3.10 8.3 enable
ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn ./scripts/xf-addon 2.3.10 8.3 disable
ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn ./scripts/xf-addon 2.3.10 8.3 validate-json
ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn ./scripts/xf-addon 2.3.10 8.3 sync-json
```

### Stop an instance but keep files/database

```bash
./scripts/xf-down 2.3.10 8.3
```

### Destroy an instance completely

```bash
./scripts/xf-down 2.3.10 8.3 --destroy
```

This deletes:

```text
instances/xf-2.3.10-php-8.3/
```

including the database, extracted XenForo files, ngrok token copy, logs, and generated config.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `Missing XenForo archive`

The script could not find the expected ZIP.

Example:

```bash
./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.3
```

requires:

```text
archives/xenforo-2.3.10.zip
```

### `Missing command: docker`

Docker is not installed or not available in your shell path. Start Docker Desktop and retry.

### `Missing command: ngrok`

You used `PUBLIC=ngrok` but ngrok is not installed.

On macOS:

```bash
brew install ngrok
```

### Installer fails and then add-on install complains about missing tables

If you see something like:

```text
Table 'xenforo.xf_data_registry' doesn't exist
```

the XenForo install did not complete correctly. Destroy the half-created instance and rerun:

```bash
./scripts/xf-down 2.3.10 8.3 --destroy
./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.3
```

### ngrok URL changed but XenForo still uses the old board URL

If an instance was already installed, XenForo may still store the old board URL.

For a clean public test:

```bash
./scripts/xf-down 2.3.10 8.3 --destroy

PUBLIC=ngrok \
ADDON_ID=Vendor/AddOn \
./scripts/xf-up 2.3.10 8.3
```

### PHP 7.2 build issues

Very old PHP Docker images are based on old Debian releases. This project rewrites the Debian Buster package sources to archived Debian mirrors before running `apt-get update`.

If your platform still cannot build PHP 7.2, try PHP 7.4 first to confirm Docker itself is working:

```bash
./scripts/xf-up 2.1.15 7.4
```

## Built while testing AI Rules Moderation

This lab was originally built while testing real-world XenForo add-on compatibility across old XenForo branches, old PHP runtimes, modern PHP runtimes, and public callback environments.

The original use case was **AI Rules Moderation**, a commercial XenForo add-on for conservative AI-assisted moderation triage.

AI Rules Moderation is designed to help forum owners check new and edited content against administrator-defined rules, send questionable content into the normal XenForo moderation workflow, and reduce repetitive manual review without replacing human moderators.

You can find AI Rules Moderation on XenForo Resource Manager:

```text
https://xenforo.com/community/resources/ai-rules-moderation.10496/
```

This repository does not include AI Rules Moderation files. Bring your own licensed add-on files and mount them using `ADDON_ID` and `ADDON_SOURCE`.
